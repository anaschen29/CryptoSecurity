RSA Attack!

We implement the broadcast attack, which conducts an inverse-CRT to determine the original message, given encryptions of it under different RSA keys. 

Files:
keys.txt: RSA public keys

ciphertexts.txt: Ciphertexts corresponding to the same message under the above keys

rsa attack.py: The actual attack!

In particular, we resort to a special root-finding algorithm as the floating-point methods fail with such huge numbers.

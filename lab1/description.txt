Theory teaches us that it is insecure to use the same key twice for symmetric encryption. This point of this assignment is to design a cryptanalytic 
attack which demonstrates this: we use a library of known English words to completely retrieve two original message that were encrypted 
using the same key under symmetric encryption.

1000_dict.txt : contains a list of 'valid' English words. 

c1.bin : first ciphertext

c2.bin : second ciphertext
